h2. Pagination

Pagination is the process of organizing information onto a page such that a fixed number of items appear on each page. Webby provides some methods for paginating information.

Let's assume that your website has a collection of articles in a folder called "articles" in the content directory. The goal is to display these articles ten at a time in reverse chronological order.

<pre>
---
title: Articles
filter:
- erb
- textile
---
h2. <%= h(@page.title) %>

<%
  articles = @pages.find(:all, :in_directory => "articles",
                         :sort_by => "mtime", :reverse => true)
  paginate(articles, 10) do |page|
%>
<%= page.render %>
<hr />
<% end %>

<%= link_to("Prev", @pager.prev) if @pager.prev? %>
<%= link_to("Next", @pager.next) if @pager.next? %>
</pre>

In the example page above, the first step is get the collection of articles we are interested in the paginating. This is done using the <code>@pages.find</code> method to retrieve all the pages from the articles folder sorted in reverse order by modification time. When we have the collection of articles, we pass them to the @paginate@ method along with the desired number of articles per page. The @paginate@ method will pass each page in the @articles@ collection to the supplied block of code, but for each ten pages passed to the block, a new webpage will be created.

Inside the block of code we simple render each page and separate the rendered pages using a horizontal rule. Finally, at the end of each page we generate _Prev_ and _Next_ links to supply navigation.

The <code>@pager</code> object provides a few other useful methods:

* *number*  --  the current page number
* *number_of_pages*  --  the total number of pages that will be generated
* *first_item_number*  --  the "item number" of the first item on this page
* *last_item_number*  --  the "item number" of the last item on this page
* *first*  --  a reference to the first pager (useful for @link_to@ methods)
* *last*  --  a reference to the last pager (useful for @link_to@ methods)
* *page( number )*  --  a reference to the pager for page _number_ (useful for @link_to@ methods)

bq. *NOTE*: the <code>@pager</code> is not instantiated until _after_ the @paginate@ method has been called. Therefore, references to other pages and item numbers cannot be made before the @paginate@ method is called in the page.

h2. CodeRay

To include "CodeRay":http://coderay.rubychan.de/ syntax highlighting support in a page you need to have the @coderay@ gem installed, and you need to include the CodeRay stylesheet in your layout. The following example shows a page that uses CodeRay syntax highlighting combined with Textile markup.

<pre>
---
title:  CodeRay Example
filter:
- erb
- textile
--- 
h2. <%= h(@page.title) %>

This is the @render_page@ function from the Webby static website generation
system. It is used to render a page by applying the specified filters in
succession to the page contents.

<% coderay(:lang => "ruby", :line_numbers => "inline") do -%>
# call-seq:
#    render_page    => string
#
# Apply the desired filters to the page. The filters to apply are
# determined from the page's meta-data.
#
def render_page
  ary = []
  str = ::Webby::File.read(@page.path)

  @page.filter.to_a.each do |filter|
    str = self.send(filter + '_filter', str)
  end

  str
end
<% end -%>
</pre>

There are more options that can be passed to the CodeRay syntax highlighter than those shown in the example above. Take a look at the RDoc documentation for the "CodeRay Helper":/rdoc/classes/Webby/Helpers/CodeRayHelper.html class for more information.
